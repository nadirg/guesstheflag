# guesstheflag

This is my code for project 2 as part of the Swift tutorial from Hacking With Swift.

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/2/overview

In this project, I made a game using UIkit where players have to guess which flag correspond to a prompted country.

The game lasts 10 rounds and for each valid response, 1 point is added. When the answer is wrong, 1 point is deducted.

At the end of the game, the final score is indicated and the game can be restarted.
